(2013) are implemented in the\r\n  [`detect`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=detect) R package.\r\n\r\n* The **estimates** of singing rates and effective\r\n  detection distances for North American boreal forest songbird species\r\n  is provided as part of the `QPAD` package.\r\n\r\nUsing offsets derived from these estimates can significantly reduce the \r\ncomputational burden when fitting complex models to large data sets and \r\ncan be used with a wide range of statistical techniques for \r\ninference and prediction of avian densities.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nGet the recent version as:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"psolymos/QPAD\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\n!!!
